Answer 1
"For" loops, "while" loops, and "do-while" loops are the three forms of iteration constructions frequently used in programming.
The precise constraints of the task at hand determine which iteration construct should be used.
"while" loops and "do-while" loops are similar, the latter checks the condition at the conclusion of each iteration.
The choice of the preferable iteration construct frequently depends on readability, maintainability, and the particular
 requirements of the work, even while it is true that in many circumstances any of these structures can be used to produce the same effect.
For iterating over an array's items, "for" loops are often preferred when working with arrays since they offer a simple and 
straightforward syntax in a deliberate manner.


Answer 2
The subsequent actions were conducted in order to test and troubleshoot the programme:
Initial Testing: 
A variety of inputs were used to run the programme and check for syntax problems and proper user prompting.

Reviewing the Logic of the Code: The code was examined to find any logical flaws or inconsistent operations.

 Debugging Tools: Potential problems were examined by looking at variables and their values at various stages 
with the aid of debugging tools like breakpoints and variable watches.

 Code Review: Peer code reviews were carried out to get other viewpoints and suggestions for enhancements.

Through the use of these testing and debugging techniques, any syntax errors were found by the compiler or 
interpreter, while semantic issues, such as improper behaviour or calculations, were found through careful review,
 examination of error messages, and comparison of the program's output to anticipated results.

Answer 3
Open the given output.txt file to view the output that your programme produced.
Open the w6p2_master_output.txt file to view the program's anticipated output.
In your output.txt file, find line number 6 as shown in the error response.
Find the character's ASCII code in your output.txt file and contrast it with the anticipated
 ASCII value given in the error feedback. The character at column 33 in line 6 of your 
output.txt file in this case, according to the error message, should be the ASCII code for 
the character '0,' which is 48. Check to see if the character in column 33 in line 6 now
 corresponds to the anticipated '0' (ASCII code 48) as stated in the error message.
