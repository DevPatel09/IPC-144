IPC Workshop 1 Project-2
Reflection.

1)Yes, I have experienced the programming languages such as C programming, Java and Python. I found  them
intreseting and with the time, I have noticed that this languages attracts me and i want to learn
and explore new things in this programming world.

2)There are a lot of processes that happens between the C text file into a excetuable program. It went to 
following steps: 1)Scanning of the source code and then compilation is done into assembly language.
                 2)Machine code is formed form the assembly language.
                 3)It follows to the linking process where the file is formed.
During this process, it also checks the errors in the source code and display on the screen so that programmer
get to know about their mistakes.

3)This course is very important which helps to strengthen my basics in C language. It provide solid foundation
which will help me further in other languages. Talking about my goals, the first one is to learn everything 
about C language whether it's a short topic or a long one. There are other goals such as to solve problems in 
real world and want to adapt new technologies and get to learn about them. Technologies and it's accessories 
changes with time, so my expectation is to learn and get to know them with passing time.
