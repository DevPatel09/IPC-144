Ans 1) Price 1's value is saved as a float data type, therefore it does not 
           accurately reflect the intended value, nor does the converted cent value
          that goes along with it. A value loses some information when it is stored as a
          float data type then cast as an integer. The output will not be what the user 
        anticipates as a result of this. On the other hand, when a double value is forced 
         to become an integer number, it returns its closest form. it may be slightly less or 
          equal to that number.

Ans 2)There is no data loss or value change when an integer variable is transformed as 
          a double variable. Integer data types contain less information than double data types, 
         hence this is why. The additional space in the double datatype does not affect the value 
         of the integer data type when it is promoted.

Ans 3) 1)Since the variable "result" must be saved as an integer data type, its value is 72. 
                The closest value to 72, which is the result of casting the true answer, 72.45, into an integer.

            2)The values are:a) 0.00
                                             b)72
                                             c)0.00
                                             d)72

            3)The data type used in examples 1 and 3's printf function is double. The integer'result' is used 
              to store the variable. As a result, the value displayed is 0, since a double value cannot be stored as 
              an integer but can instead be stored as a double data type.
