Workshop 4 reflect: 

Ans 1)- When indentation is used and the code layout is consistent, nested blocks of code are easier to comprehend.
- When variables and functions have evocative names, it is similar to comprehend the function and behaviour of various
 code parts.
- Selection enables the programme to make choices and employ reasoning in statements, selection is a crucial programming notion.
Without selection, programmes can only run from beginning to end without being able to perform a variety of alternative sequences.
- Making efficient use of white space, such as introducing new lines and leaving spaces between symbols, can increase 
 legibility.
- Code is more legible and intelligible when line length is restricted and comments are used sparingly.
- Regularly examining and reorganising code can make it easier to read and manage.
- I have used "if" statement to check whether the user is entering the amount of items is equal to, greater than or less than the number of items that 
the user had picked earlier.
- I have also used "else if" statements just after the "if" statements to check the condition , if this is true then print the statements which are there in
else if body case.

This method makes it easier to understand and maintain the code because it includes the iteration, sequence and condition,
 especially in the sections involving iteration in the selection logic.

Ans 2) - Nested logic, which enables programmers to organise and organise their code in a logical manner, is significantly used in programming.
- If nesting is not employed, code organisation would become challenging, leading to longer and more complex code files.
- Conditional statements and algorithms that significantly rely on nested structures are excuted in part thanks to nesting.
-Nested logic, which gives the developer the opportunity to communicate the desired organisation and links among various components of the 
code, can improve the readability and maintainability of code.
- Coding is more easily modularized, resued, and maintainable when it is organised into layered components.

Ans 3) - Using a chain of "if" possible course of action structures may be ineffective in some circumstances.
- Repetiive "if" statements can result in processing that is unneeded and slow down performance.
- Adding more "if" statements to a programme without including a "else if" clause can complicate the code's structure.
- The code would have to check each condition separately if there were no "else if" instructions, adding additional execution cost.
- The "if/else if" alternative path logic is preferable when several conditions and various actions based on those conditions are involved since it 
offers better code organisation, maintainability, and performance.
